## Summary

You're going to make a terminal game

## Description

1. You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
1. Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1.  You can do this as much as you want.
1. At any point, if you are currently using your teeth, you can buy a pair of rusty scissors for $5.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.
1. Using the rusty scissors, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $5.  You can do this as much as you want.
1. At any point, if you are currently using rusty scissors, you can buy an old-timey push lawnmower for $25.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.
1. Using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $50.  You can do this as much as you want.
1. At any point, if you are currently using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can buy a fancy battery-powered lawnmower for $250.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.
1. Using the the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $100.  You can do this as much as you want.
1. At any point, if you are currently using the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can hire a team of starving students for $500.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.
1. Using the the team of starving students, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $250.  You can do this as much as you want.
1. You win the game when you have a team of starving students and $1000.  In this situation, send a message to the user telling them, they've won.

## Hungry for More?

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple tools, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 scissors, and an old-timey push lawnmower means you earn $60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half price
